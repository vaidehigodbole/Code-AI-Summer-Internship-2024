**Sentiment Analysis on Customer feedback using NLP:** This project, "Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback using NLP," uses Natural Language Processing to evaluate customer reviews. It employs the VADER sentiment analyzer and TextBlob to determine sentiment scores and subjectivity. These scores are categorized into classes such as Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Highly Negative. Built with Streamlit, the application features a user-friendly interface for real-time text input, sentiment analysis, and text cleaning. It also provides a graphical representation of sentiment score distributions and displays a sample of the processed data, offering a clear understanding of customer sentiments.

**Using advance excel and power BI Analyze whatsapp data:** The project to analyze WhatsApp data using advanced Excel and Power BI involved importing and cleaning large datasets, followed by comprehensive data analysis to uncover patterns and insights. Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created using Power BI to effectively communicate the findings. This project demonstrated the ability to handle real-world data, utilize advanced analytical tools, and derive meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.

**Diabetes Perdiction and Analysis:** The "Diabetes Prediction and Analysis" project explores the relationships between various health indicators and diabetes status using data visualization, logistic regression, and statistical analysis. Key components include visualizing relationships with factors like smoking and alcohol consumption, building a logistic regression model for diabetes prediction, and performing ANOVA to identify significant differences in health indicators between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This project aims to identify key predictors of diabetes, develop predictive models, and validate these relationships statistically, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.

**Book recommendation system:** The Book Recommendation System project implements a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate personalized book recommendations. It involves loading and preprocessing book data, training a matrix factorization model like SVD to learn user and item latent factors, and using the trained model to predict ratings and recommend top books for users. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to build a functional book recommendation system that learns from user preferences and history.
